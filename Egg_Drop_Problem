4.The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving N = 2 eggs and a building with K = 36 floors.
Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing. We make a few assumptions:

An egg that survives a fall can be used again. 
A broken egg must be discarded. 
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs. 
If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor. 
If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall. 
It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that the 36th-floor does not cause an egg to break.

Solution:

import java.util.*;

class Main {
    
    static int[][] memo;

    public static int eggDrop(int floor, int egg) {
        
        memo = new int[floor + 1][egg + 1];
        return eggDropHelper(floor, egg);
    }

    private static int eggDropHelper(int floor, int egg) {
        
        if (floor == 0 || floor == 1) {
            return floor;
        }
        if (egg == 1) {
            return floor;
        }
        
        if (memo[floor][egg] != 0) {
            return memo[floor][egg];
        }

        int minTrials = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        
        for (int x = 1; x <= floor; x++) {
            int breaks = eggDropHelper(x - 1, egg - 1); 
            int doesNotBreak = eggDropHelper(floor - x, egg); 
           
            int result = 1 + Math.max(breaks, doesNotBreak);

            if (result < minTrials) {
                minTrials = result;
            }
        }

        memo[floor][egg] = minTrials;

        return minTrials;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter number of floors: ");
        int floor = s.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter number of eggs: ");
        int egg = s.nextInt();

        int minimum = eggDrop(floor, egg);
        System.out.println("Minimum number of trials: " + minimum);

        s.close();
    }
}
